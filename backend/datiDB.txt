  "title": "From Lake Tenno to Canale, a stroll through the countryside",
  "description": "This walks touches on two points of particular interest in Garda Trentino: Lake Tenno, one of the most pristine lakes in all of Italy, and the nearby medieval village of Canale di Tenno, where time seems to have stood still. This is a very easy trek without any serious elevation gain, a walk suited to everyone. Lake Tenno is famed for the colour of its water which varies from turquoise to emerald green according to the season. It is safe to swim in the lake and it is a popular destination in summer for people who just want to relax on the rocky beaches. The Tenno area is part of the nature reserve of the UNESCO Biosphere "Alpi Ledrensi e Judicaria", a prestigious award which identifies environments with a rich biodiversity and history which have been developed while maintain strong links between the area, tourism, farming and tradition.",

  "roadbook": "From the car park beside Lake Tenno head down the steps which lead to the beach. There you take the trail on the left which runs around the perimeter of the lake. When you come to the island, go up to the kiosk bar (open in summer, with toilet facilities) and then leave it behind you as you come to the dirt road.  Here keep to the right until you come to the next junction where you take the left turn and follow directions for Canale. It is only a short distance to the village. On the way back you follow the same route as far as the last turn-off (at Frioc): go straight on towards Mattoni and back to the starting point.",

This medium difficulty walk starts from Rifugio Predaia and reaches the incredibly panoramic summit of Corno di Tres!

  "title": "The chromatic contrast of Corno Nero and Corno Bianco",
  "description": "Extremely panoramic hiking loop, which allows you to admire the Lagorai chain, the lower Val di Fiemme and to see the Val di Cembra in the distance. We are in Passo Oclini, where the road stops and you can only aim upwards towards the sky. The itinerary proposes the ascent of both peaks that frame the pass, but it is possible to go up just on one of them. The names of the two peaks say a lot about their composition: the Corno Nero is made of porphyry and dark rocks of volcanic origin, while the Corno Bianco stands out with its white dolomite. For this reason the two peaks are so different.",

  "roadbook": "At Passo Oclini (1.989 m), just behind Hotel Schwarzhorn, take trail No. 502 first rising steeply and then continuing on a more even scenic route along the ridge to the summit of Corno Nero (2.491 m). From the summit take trail No. 502, with its spectacular route along the crest, to Monte Palone, and then descend to Baito di Cugola (1.900 m). A brief ascent to the right leads to Passo Cugola. From here take trail No. 14 in the direction of Malga Cugola Bassa (Alpine dairy). A good forest road (with markings for trail No. 14), leads to Malga Corandin – Gurndin Alm (1.952 m). From here there are two options: return to Passo Oclini on the easy unsurfaced road to the right (30 minutes), or turn left on this same track after 100 metres and take trail H, following directions for Corno Bianco continuing along this path to the summit of the mountain (2.317 m). From the top of Corno Bianco, backtrack down the route taken on the way up and then branch left, still on trail H, descending directly to Passo Oclini (1 hour 30 minutes from Malga Corandin – Gurndin Alm).",
